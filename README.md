# UT2003-BadAdrenaline

Welcome to Beyond Unreal news, I am your host QAPete.
A couple of months ago an accident happened in the Liandri adrenaline pill factory. By mistake they spilled the chemical called Rhenium Oxoide Tri Thallium into the mixture for the Adrenalin pills. At first nothing seemed wrong with the pills, so they just scattered them around the arenas.
Recently reports came in about strange side effects from some bad adrenaline pills. The side effects only lasted for a couple of seconds. Because the recall on all adrenaline pills would cost the Liandri Corporation to much money and time they left them where they were. "It's an added hazard to the already very hazardous arena's, so the players just have to look out when they pick up adrenaline.", Mark Rein said, the Liandri spokesperson. So here's a warning for all participants in the Unreal Tournament, watch out for the Bad Adrenaline.

Many of the effects are based on the 1994 game: Rise of the Triad.

# Installation

Copy the files BadAdrenaline.u and BadAdrenaline.int to your system directory. Copy the BadAdrenaline_tex.utx to your Texture directory.
The "Bad Adrenaline" mutator will now show up in the mutator list.
You have to add the following to your system configuration (UT2003.ini):

```
[Engine.GameEngine]
ServerPackages=BadAdrenaline
```

The system name for the mutator is: BadAdrenaline.BAmut

Note: this mutator replaces the PlayerController in the game with it's own, this will make it incompatible with any other mod that also replaces the PlayerController.
